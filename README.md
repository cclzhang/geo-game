# [A Simple Flag Game](https://cclzhang.github.io/geo-game/)

Inspired by the og [Geo Challenge](https://www.facebook.com/geochallenge/). This game is 1 minute long and tests your knowledge on some of the trickiest flags in the world. 

*This game is so difficult if you can manage to get them all right on the first try, I'll give you $5 out of pure respect!*
